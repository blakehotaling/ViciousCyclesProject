  <p>Here at Vicious cycles, it is a priority of ours to supply safe, durable, quality bicycles for your children and grandchildren. There’s nothing quite like the first time seeing your child ride a bicycle on their own. We here at Vicious Cycles want to deliver you with the products you need to see your little one ride off into the sunset. All of the bicycles sold here are quality tested and assured safe for your child to ride, taking the worry away so there is plenty of room for fond memories and big smiles. </p>

    <p>What we offer does not simply stop at selling safe bicycles for your children. We also offer appropriate apparel for a day out on the bike, including but not limited to helmets, gloves, elbow pads, knee pads, water bottles, and so much more! All products are tested to ensure your little one stays safe.</p>
    
    <p>Vicious Cycles offers a variety of different accessories for your child’s bike! These accessories include both safety and aesthetic equipment so you and your child can customize their bike to their liking! We sell training wheels, horns, baskets, colored grip tape, cupholders, locks, and even fun streamers for the handlebars.

    <p>Need a replacement part? We got you covered! We sell all bike parts individually in the case that a part of your child’s bicycle breaks or gets worn out. These include new wheels, spokes, handlebar covers, brakes, seats, chains, pedals, forks, and any other part that needs replacing!
